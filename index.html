        <p>
          My name is Mara Goodman. I moved to New York about two years ago to
          pursue my fashion career, after attending university in Paris. I fell
          in love with Paris and am lucky enough to have the opportunity to
          travel extensively for work(52 countries and counting). I hope to move
          back someday! But in the meantime, I'm quite content discovering
          everything that New York has to offer.
        </p>

          I hope to use the skills I learn in this course to further integrate
          techology into the fashion landscape. I graudauted university with a
          double BSc in Finance and International Business Administration. As my
          job is heavily based in retail mathematics and statistics,I intend to
          apply these qualifications and newfound web development knowledge to
          eventually create my own retail platform.

          Some of the things I have fallen in love with in NYC are going to
          Yankees and Rangers games, my beautiful apartment in the Meatpacking
          district, the ability to get pizza at any hour of the day, the Strand
          bookstore, soft serve ice cream, and the amazing people I've met along
          the way.
